# Measuring-device
This circuit is for a Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) with a LED indentifier. 
It's purpose is to measure a distance, return it, and illiminate the LED if alloted under certain parameters.
It is a fairly simple circuit with only needing one UltraSonic Distance Sensor, one LED, three resistors (one 470 ohm resistor and two 330 ohm resistors) and ten jumper wires. (You can also change the distance to whatever you like, just change the numerical value at the end of the statement: if distance < 20.)
Feel free to comment on any issues or hiccups. As well as, if you have any pointers for me, as this is apart of a final project for a class and I'm not advanced or an expert at coding or circuits as of right now.
