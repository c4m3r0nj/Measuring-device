# Measuring-device
This circuit is for a Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04) with a LED indentifier. 
It's purpose is to measure a distance, return it, and illiminate the LED if alloted under certain parameters.
It is a fairly simple circuit with only needing one UltraSonic Distance Sensor, one LED, three resistors, and ten jumper wires.
Feel free to comment on an issues or hiccups. As well as, if you have any pointers for me, as this is apart of a final project for a class and I'm not advanced or expert at coding as of right now.
